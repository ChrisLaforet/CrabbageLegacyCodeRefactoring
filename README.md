# Crabbage
A graphical implementation of Cribbage in C# by Ryan Manny - Currently abandoned
The purpose of pulling this code and engaging with it is twofold:
- To practice implementing tests on a legacy codebase for refactoring and extending the code with TDD
- To a lesser extent, as this exercise moves forward, to implement the original author's intent for the code.

## REFATORING TODO:
- Pin current functionality with characterization tests
- Identify areas with poor architecture and refine them with TDD
- Identify incomplete areas and implement them with TDD
- Push forward with implementing the TODOs below

Should the second objective be met, then a pull request on the original code needs to be made and the improvements submitted.

## Current Features
- Deck and dealing
- Throwing away
- Beta Cribbage Throwing AI (With slow, perfect-play option and fast heuristic option)

## TODO:
- Implement GUI
- Add pegging functionality
- Create pegging AI (may not be perfectable)
- Add scoring
- Integrate different rounds of each hand
